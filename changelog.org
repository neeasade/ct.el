** 0.3

*** Changed
- Changed the parameter conventions for clarity
    - ~c~ -> ~color~
    - ~transform~ -> ~edit-fn~
- ~ct-tint-contrast~ renamed to ~ct-contrast-min~
- Move ~ct-make-*~ functions into the generation macro
- Make readme generated, moved

*** Added
- added okLAB support - built on top of color.el, so only enabled if your emacs has [[https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/lisp/color.el?id=c5e5940ba40b801270bbe02b92576eac36f73222][this commit]]
- ~ct-point-*~ functions for editing the color at point interactively
- ~ct-aiterate~ an anaphoric macro for ct-iterate
- ~ct-aiterations~ an anaphoric macro for ct-iterations
- ~ct-contrast-max~ function to ensure a maximum contrast ratio
- ~ct-contrast-clamp~ function to clamp to a specified contrast ratio

** 0.2 <2022-06-09>
*** Added
- Colorspace property inc, dec functions for editing a function by a minimum amount needed to affect change
    - Example: ~ct-edit-lab-l-inc~
    - Note: this allows for *much* greater precision in iteration contexts
- Generated documentation and examples in the readme, inspired by the dash.el style
- ~ct-complement~, a function for returning a complement function
- ~ct-average~, a function for mixing colors in a selected colorspace

*** Changed
- Most colorspace functions are now generated with a big macro
- Change ~ct-transform~ prefix -> ~ct-edit~
- ~ct-tint-ratio~ is now more precise, thanks fo the ~l-inc~ functions
- Don't make ~ct-iteration~ derive from ~ct-iterations~ (performance improvement)
- Replace instances of ~ct-range~ and ~number-sequence~ with ~-iota~

*** Fixed
- Fixed ~ct-gradient~ (negative steps would result in repeated colors or off-by-one errors)

*** Deprecated
The following renames happened (compat layer is present)

- ~ct-name-distance~ -> ~ct-distance~
- ~ct-lab-lighten~ -> ~ct-edit-lab-l-inc~
- ~ct-lab-darken~ -> ~ct-edit-lab-l-dec~
- ~ct-is-light-p~ -> ~ct-light-p~
