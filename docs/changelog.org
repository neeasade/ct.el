** 0.x
*** Added
- ~ct-point~ functions for editing the color at point interactively

** 0.2 <2022-06-09>
*** Added
- Colorspace property inc, dec functions for editing a function by a minimum amount needed to affect change
    - Example: ~ct-edit-lab-l-inc~
    - Note: this allows for *much* greater precision in iteration contexts
- Generated documentation and examples in the readme, inspired by the dash.el style
- ~ct-complement~, a function for returning a complement function
- ~ct-average~, a function for mixing colors in a selected colorspace

*** Changed
- Most colorspace functions are now generated with a big macro
- Change ~ct-transform~ prefix -> ~ct-edit~
- ~ct-tint-ratio~ is now more precise, thanks fo the ~l-inc~ functions
- Don't make ~ct-iteration~ derive from ~ct-iterations~ (performance improvement)
- Replace instances of ~ct-range~ and ~number-sequence~ with ~-iota~

*** Fixed
- Fixed ~ct-gradient~ (negative steps would result in repeated colors or off-by-one errors)

*** Deprecated
The following renames happened (compat layer is present)

- ~ct-name-distance~ -> ~ct-distance~
- ~ct-lab-lighten~ -> ~ct-edit-lab-l-inc~
- ~ct-lab-darken~ -> ~ct-edit-lab-l-dec~
- ~ct-is-light-p~ -> ~ct-light-p~

** 0.1 <2021-02-19>
